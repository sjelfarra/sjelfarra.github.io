<font face="verdana"><p>Good intentions don’t always produce the best outcomes, and the federal regulations requiring public schools to provide healthier food to their students is an example of such. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The “nutritious” food options have not been well received by students in California schools, with statistics showing a 3 percent drop in student participation state-wide from the 2011-2012 school year to the 2012-2013 school year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, public school lunch funding is reliant on students’ purchasing food from their cafeterias. And if students aren’t happy with the options with which they are presented, they may not buy food from their school, which means less money for schools to spend on lunch options.</p>

<p>“The only way we get money is if the students eat our food,” said Karen Luna, the Nutritional Director of East Palo Alto schools. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The changes in food options and ingredients were a result of First Lady Michelle Obama’s campaign against obesity in the United States. Her ‘Let’s Move’ initiative had a rollout plan to implement healthier eating and more exercise in America’s schools. Some of the requirements of her programs include emphasis on portion-size and healthier meal options, like whole grains and low-fat milk.</p>

<p>However, as seen in the recently trending #ThanksMichelleObama on Twitter in November, many students nationwide are unhappy with the options they have been given for lunch. </p>

<p>“Had a very #healthylunch today,” Hunter Whitney of Wisconsin tweeted. “The apple definitely made up for the `mystery mush’ #ThanksMichelleObama.”</p>

<p>Sarah Hashmi the Regional Dietician for the Ravenswood School District has been working to implement what students in her district want to eat with healthy ingredients. </p>

<p>“We don’t have much to work with, but we are doing our best to make the students happy,” said Hashmi. 

<p>Although the schools have regulations for healthier ingredients, like whole grain and more vegetables, they still serve questionably healthy food, like hot dogs, nachos and pizza. Students tweeted photos of these food options as well. </p>

<p>“2.25 for a corndog and a milk for lunch. Thanks Michelle Obama,” said user @macbuffs from Oklahoma.</p>

<p>“The kids still want the same food, but they don’t like the taste when it’s made with whole grain or low fat milk,” said Hashmi. “So they choose not to buy the food.”</p>

<p>In order to gauge what the students want, Hashmi has handed out surveys to parents and students where they are able to write what kinds of food they would like to see on the menu and what they dislike. The last survey, which took place in April of 2014, indicated that students wanted to see more chicken and fish as well as quinoa and lentils.</p>

<p>But since the healthy food program began its rollout four years ago, California schools have only received 6 cents more per student lunch, which is very little for administrators to work with. </p>

<p>“Six cents doesn’t cover the cost of one fruit or vegetable so we are trying to cut other costs to keep the program up to par,” said Luna.</p>

<p>The Healthy, Hungry-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), which was passed by Congress in 2010, requires school meals to consist of 51% whole grains, increase the amount of fruits and vegetables offered to students, restrict saturated fats to less than 10% of meal calories, impose calorie restrictions and only allows skim or 1% milk to be served. On the other hand, there is no mention of carbohydrates which are closely linked to diabetes and obesity.</p>

<p> “Low fat diets cause our brains to suffer and our organs to suffer,” said nutritionist Daniella Gil. “We need a certain amount of healthy fats in the food we eat.” </p>

<p>And in terms of whole grains, Gil said healthy whole grains are quinoa or brown rice.</p>

<p>“Once it’s but into a bread or cereal, it’s not whole grain,” said Gil. “It’s processed and unhealthy.”</p>

<p>Regardless of the long way school lunches have to go before the are considered fully nutritious, a study from July showed school lunches actually had healthier ingredients than those students brought from home.</p></font>
